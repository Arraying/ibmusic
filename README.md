# ibmusic

A bot that will stream audio 24/7 in a specified channel, no commands.

## How to use

1) Compile using `sbt assembly` in the root directory. Alternatively contact me for a prebuilt jar.
2) Wait a few minutes because Scala is pretty slow.
3) Locate the jar (`target/scala_X.X.X/ibmusic-assembly-X.X.X.jar`).
4) Run the jar with runtime parameters in the following order: token, channel ID and YT/source link.
5) Profit.
